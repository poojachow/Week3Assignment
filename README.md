Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List:
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

Least Common Ancestor
Find the lowest common ancestor in an unordered binary tree given two values in the tree.
Lowest common ancestor : the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or 

Identical Binary Trees:
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem
Example :
Input : 
   1       1
  / \     / \
 2   3   2   3
Output : 
  1 or True

Matrix Search:
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.

Rotated Sorted Array Search:
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7  might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Input : [4 5 6 7 0 1 2] and target = 4
Output : 0
